# All Ruby Books

This is the JSON backend of the All Ruby Books website / page.

The book collection was started by [Florent Guilleux](https://github.com/Florent2).  Thanks! Merci!


Contributions welcome! Just send pull requests.

Formerly @ [`www.allrubybooks.com`](http://www.allrubybooks.com/)

**Update 2021** - Work-in-progess - getting converted over to the new home at Planet Ruby.

For now the current plan to use this collection and merge in the [`/books-old`](https://github.com/planetruby/books-old) repo
and convert all book datafiles to YAML with directories by publication year (e.g. `/2019`, `/2020`, `/2021` etc.).
